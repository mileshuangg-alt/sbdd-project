# Project Decisions

## D001 — Choose DiffSBDD as the initial reproduction target

**Date:** 2026-08-05

### Decision

Use **DiffSBDD** as the first structure-based generative model to reproduce.

### Rationale

- Official implementation accompanying the publication.
- Published pretrained checkpoints are available.
- Supports pocket-conditioned de novo ligand generation.
- Provides documented inference examples that can be reproduced before attempting modifications.
- Establishes a concrete baseline before evaluating alternative models (e.g., TargetDiff or SemlaFlow).

### Alternatives considered

- TargetDiff
- SemlaFlow

These remain candidates for future comparison but were not selected as the initial reproduction target.

### Revisit when

- The official example cannot be reproduced.
- The repository is no longer maintainable.
- Another model proves substantially easier to reproduce or better aligned with the project goals.
